//! Module containing support for the Aggregate pattern.
//!
//! ## What is an Aggregate?
//!
//! An [Aggregate] is the most important concept in your domain.
//!
//! It represents the entities your business domain is composed of,
//! and the business logic your domain is exposing.
//!
//! For example: in an Order Management bounded-context (e.g. a
//! microservice), the concepts of Order or Customer are two potential
//! [Aggregate]s.
//!
//! Aggregates expose mutations with the concept of **commands**:
//! from the previous example, an Order might expose some commands such as
//! _"Add Order Item"_, or _"Remove Order Item"_, or _"Place Order"_
//! to close the transaction.
//!
//! In Event Sourcing, the Aggregate state is modified by the usage of
//! **Domain Events**, which carry some or all the fields in the state
//! in a certain logical meaning.
//!
//! As such, commands in Event Sourcing will **produce** Domain Events.
//!
//! Aggregates should provide a way to **fold** Domain Events on the
//! current value of the state, to produce the next state.
//!
//! ## Aggregate in `eventually`
//!
//! `eventually` supports the Aggregates through the [`Aggregate`] trait.
//!
//! An [`Aggregate`] allows to:
//! * specify the available commands through the [`Command`] associated
//!   type,
//! usually an `enum`,
//! * define how to handle commands through the [`handle`] method,
//! * specify the Aggregate's Domain Events through the [`Event`]
//! associated type, usually an `enum`,
//! * define the transition logic from one state to another by an [`Event`],
//! through the [`apply`] method.
//!
//! An [`Aggregate`] is essentialy an _actor_, which means it should contain
//! all the dependencies it needs to execute commands (e.g. repositories,
//! external clients, validators, etc...)
//!
//! Let's take the Orders Management example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use eventually::Aggregate;
//! use futures::future::BoxFuture;
//! use async_trait::async_trait;
//!
//! // This is the state of our Order, which contains one or more items,
//! // and whether it has been placed or not.
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct OrderState {
//!     items: Vec<OrderItem>,
//!     placed: bool,
//! }
//!
//! // This is a single order item, which contains the order SKU, the number
//! // of quantities of the same item and the price.
//! struct OrderItem {
//!     sku: String,
//!     quantity: u32,
//!     price: f32,
//! }
//!
//! // Let's say we have a catalog of available items in our system.
//! //
//! // We want to make sure that each item that has been added to the Order
//! // is available in the catalog.
//! //
//! // We're going to use this trait in the Aggregate implementation,
//! // when handling events to add OrderItems.
//! trait OrderItemsCatalog: Send + Sync {
//!     fn get_item(&self, sku: String) -> BoxFuture<OrderItem>;
//! }
//!
//! // This is the list of all the commands that are available on our Aggregate.
//! enum OrderCommand {
//!     // Make the order final and place it to the production line.
//!     PlaceOrder,
//!     // Add an OrderItem to the Order, specifying a quantity.
//!     AddOrderItem { sku: String, quantity: u32 },
//!     // Remove an OrderItem from the Order: the item is removed
//!     // when the quantity in the Order is less or equal than
//!     // the quantity asked to be removed by the command.
//!     RemoveOrderItem { sku: String, quantity: u32 },
//! }
//!
//! // This is the list of all the domain events defined on the Order aggregate.
//! enum OrderEvent {
//!     // The list of OrderItems is updated with the specified value.
//!     OrderItemsUpdated { items: Vec<OrderItem> },
//!     // Marks the order as placed.
//!     OrderPlaced,
//! }
//!
//! // This is our Aggregate actor, which will contain all the necessary
//! // dependencies for handling commands.
//! //
//! // In this case, it will only contain the OrderItemCatalog.
//! struct OrderAggregate {
//!     catalog: std::sync::Arc<dyn OrderItemsCatalog>,
//! }
//!
//! // Implementation for the Aggregate trait.
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl Aggregate for OrderAggregate {
//!     type Id = u64;
//!     type State = OrderState;
//!     type Event = OrderEvent;
//!     type Command = OrderCommand;
//!     type Error = std::convert::Infallible; // This should be a meaningful error.
//!
//!     fn apply(state: Self::State, event: Self::Event) -> Result<Self::State, Self::Error> {
//!         unimplemented!()
//!     }
//!
//!     async fn handle(
//!         &self,
//!         id: &Self::Id,
//!         state: &Self::State,
//!         command: Self::Command,
//!     ) -> Result<Vec<Self::Event>, Self::Error>
//!     {
//!         unimplemented!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Note on [`State`]
//!
//! An [`Aggregate`]'s [`State`] type needs to implement the `Default`
//! trait, to always have an initial state representation.
//!
//! This is very important for functional _folding_ of [`Event`]s
//! done by [`apply`].
//!
//! A common type used in [`State`] is `Option<StateType>`, where
//! `StateType` doesn't usually implement `Default`. This is to represent
//! a nullable state before the first command is received.
//!
//! Given the common use-case, `eventually` has included support for
//! the [`Optional`] aggregate trait, where you can use `StateType`
//! directly in the `State` associated type.
//!
//! [`Optional`] is compatible with the [`Aggregate`] trait through
//! the [`as_aggregate`] method, or the [`optional::AsAggregate`]
//! newtype adapter.
//!
//! ### Interacting with Aggregates using `AggregateRoot`
//!
//! Interaction with Aggregates is doable through an [`AggregateRoot`].
//!
//! An [`AggregateRoot`] represents a specific Aggregate instance,
//! by managing its [`State`] and the access to submit commands.
//!
//! Access to an [`AggregateRoot`] is obtainable in two ways:
//! 1. Through the [`AggregateRootFactory`], useful for testing
//! 2. Through a [`Repository`] instance
//!
//! More on the [`Repository`] in the [module-level
//! documentation](../repository/index.html).
