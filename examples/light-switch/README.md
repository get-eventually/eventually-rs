# Example: Light Switch application

This example application is a bare minimum example of the core functionality.
Persistence is not enabled, nor is logging, nor any kind of user interface. It
just starts, runs some commands, queries the final state and prints it.

It models a "light switch". You can "install" the switch, then turn it "off" or
"on" using commands. You can issue a query to get the current state of a switch.
